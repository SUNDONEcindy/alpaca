# Alpaca ðŸ¦™
The Alpaca is a lightweight, 5", cinematic, all-round quadcopter frame with long-range capabilities designed for 20x20mm mounting pattern components. The squished x-design with a 240mm motor to motor distance still leaves room for the propellers to unload. The front frame section is on a level with the front motors which allows to get camera shots without propellers in view.

## Hardware
* 12 x M3/6mm button head screw
* 4 x M3/6mm countersunk screw
* 8 x M3/8mm button head screw
* 4 x M3/12mm button head screw
* 4 x M3/14mm button head screw
* 8 x M3/28mm, 5mm diameter standoffs
* 8 x M3 press nuts to fit 4.5mm holes

## Recommended Build
Use aluminum screws for the top and bottom plate to mount with the standoffs. The four rear holes on the top plate should be prepared for countersunk screws (this way your battery won't be damaged by the screw heads). Around 91g is the weight with half aluminum half steel hardware. The center stack should be soft-mounted, for example rubber o-rings underneath the electronic speed controller and rubber standoffs to mount the flight controller on top. There's camera plates for both Runcam and Foxeer mini size camera mounting pattern. Weight is key of this frame, take caution when adding extraneous parts. Optimal flight characteristics are between 600 and 650g.
