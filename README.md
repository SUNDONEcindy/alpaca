# Alpaca ðŸ¦™
The Alpaca is a lightweight, 5", cinematic, all-round quadcopter frame with long-range capabilities designed for 20x20mm mounting pattern components. The squished x-design with a 225mm motor to motor distance gives space for clean air and stability. The front frame section is on a level with the front motors which allows to get camera shots without propellers in view.

## Required Hardware
* 12 x M3/6mm button head screw
* 4 x M3/6mm countersunk screw
* 16 x M3/8mm button head screw
* 4 x M3/12mm button head screw
* 4 x M3/14mm button head screw
* 8 x M3/25mm standoffs
* 8 x M3 press nuts to fit 4.5mm holes

## Recommended Build
The four rear holes on the top plate should be prepared for countersunk screws. This way the battery won't be damaged by the screw heads. Use aluminum screws for the top and bottom plate to mount with the standoffs and achieve a weight around ~95g. For the lazy folks that hate chopped off aluminum screws, the frame with all steel hardware is ~105g. The center stack should be soft-mounted, for example rubber o-rings underneath the electronic speed controller and rubber standoffs to mount the flight controller on top. There's 3D printable adapters for the FPV camera. Weight is key of this frame, take caution when adding extraneous parts.
