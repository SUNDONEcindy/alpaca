# Alpaca
The Alpaca is a lightweight 5" cinematic all-round quadcopter frame with long-range capabilities designed for 20x20mm mounting pattern components. The slightly squeezed x-design with a 240mm motor to motor distance leaves good room for the propellers to unload. The front frame section is on a level with the front motors which allows to get camera shots without propellers in view.
